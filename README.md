# What is the GIFi?
Whenever I see a gif, I feel something is missing.  
That is the SOUND.  
That missing motivated me to blend the sound with gif.  
And I believed if I season it with some interactions, it would be wonderful. 
[GIFi](https://github.com/championv/gifi/wiki) is the more interactive GIF supporting sound effects.

This project implements tools for the new fileformat GIFi in Java and Javascript.  
[gifi4j](https://github.com/championv/gifi/wiki/gifi4j) supporting Java contains GIFi creator, encoder, decoder, and player.  
[gifi4js](https://github.com/championv/gifi/wiki/gifi4js) supporting Javascript contains GIFi decoder and player.  

For detailed description about the project, please see the [wiki](https://github.com/championv/gifi/wiki).
