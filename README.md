# What is the GIFi?
Whenever I see a gif, I feel something is missing.  
That is the SOUND.  
That missing motivated me to blend the sound with gif.  
And I believed if I season it with some interactions, it would be wonderful. 
GIFi is the more interactive GIF supporting sound effects.

# My analysis on GIF and other image formats
GIF is the oldest image file format used now.
I believe the advantages are its animating feature and lightness and they compose the unique experience of GIF itself.
It made GIF as a unique noun and many services such as GIPHY (GIF sharing), GIFs (human emotion expressing in GIF), and so on.
These advantages make GIF survive until now.

The currently used GIF versions are 87a and 89a which means the last update was done in 1989.
The uniqueness of GIF is cool but the computer technologies grew up too much for 25 years.
Also other image formats are born very long time ago, although there were some updates.  
// image formats birth year and lated version year table here  
// image formats / birth year / lated update date  
At this point I recognized that most of the image file formats does not care about the mobile computing environment (in other words, IoT, CPS, embedded computing, and so on) when they were born.  

Then what should image file formats include for receiving the mobile computing era?
First, images should be dynamic.  
Generally speaking, the dynamic image is called video.
But the dynamic image I mean is the video can be played without the serious video player.
Since common video has a lot of frames per second and long playing time (usually more than 10 seconds), they need special playing back techniques and cause delays before and during playing.
And it disturbs user's ears when users are not interested in that video anymore.
In this case users have to explicitly stop the video as they done to start the video.
Moreover, smart phones have their own video player and its video playing UI disturbs user's flexible web browsing by requiring more touches.
I believe that these problems of current videos and video players on the web increases the value of GIF.  

here, two ways
develope image formats
develope video formats and players.

Second, images should open their mind.  
That is images should do their endeavor to receive and understand viewer's intention and interactions.

Its javascript version decoder can run on almost any web browsers.
So I can say gifi would be the world first file format which supports the user interaction without any "serious" and "heavy" machines like flash player, java VM, and so on.
